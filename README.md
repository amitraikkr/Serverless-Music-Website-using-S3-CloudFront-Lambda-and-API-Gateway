# Christmas 2024 Music Playlist Website

<p>This project is a static website built for the <strong>Christmas 2024 Music Playlist</strong>. It hosts a curated collection of countryside and Christmas songs, offering users a joyful and festive music experience during the holiday season. The website is accessible at <a href="https://www.songs4u.life" target="_blank">www.songs4u.life</a>.</p>

## Project Details

<ul>
  <li><strong>Amazon S3:</strong> The website is hosted as a static site on Amazon S3, providing scalable and reliable hosting for the websiteâ€™s contents.</li>
  <li><strong>Amazon CloudFront:</strong> CloudFront is used as the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver the site and its resources quickly and securely across the globe.</li>
  <li><strong>API Gateway & Lambda:</strong> An API Gateway is integrated with AWS Lambda to generate presigned URLs for accessing protected S3 objects. This ensures that users can securely access the music files without exposing the S3 bucket.</li>
</ul>
